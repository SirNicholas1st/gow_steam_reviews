# God of War Steam Reviews Scraper

This is a Python project that uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape the top-rated reviews of God of War on Steam. The need for Selenium came from the fact that
Steam review pages are infinitely scrolling. Without scrolling the page has only 10 reviews.
